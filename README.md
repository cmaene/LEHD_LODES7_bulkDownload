LEHD_LODES7_bulkDownload
========================
Script to download bulk files (since wget doesn't work with the new URLs for bulk downloads, I had to write this script. Thank goodness, at least they supllied a list of files (.md5sum).)

Update on 3-30-16: 
Scripts to process files (my way, using mix of stata and bash) were added. See the main script, "led_otm_routine.sh" - for the latest version 7.2. For the previous version, v7.1, see the contents in scripts_v71.zip.
